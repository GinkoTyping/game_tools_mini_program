One of the biggest changes is the buff to the durability toolkit of the spec, allowing you to have less \"kiting\" tanking than before. The spec still possesses one of the best mob controls across any tanking spec in Mythic+, which will turn valuable for any team looking for a tank. One of their biggest advantages is having one of the highest damage profiles across all tank specs (even after the bug fixes), extremely high self-sustain and great mob-control, which are the mains reason why we believe their current performance warrants S-tier.",

In addition, a new recent build has been discovered, making their single-target and AoE damage their strongest asset, which immensely improves their performance. Although, it has been confirmed that a small portion of that is due to unintentional buff that should have only affected Arms warriors ( [崩摧]) and is soon likely to be hotfixed (which will result in a minor damage loss).

In addition, defensively and offensively are at a disadvantage compared to the top-ranked tanks, further pushing them down the list. Overall, it is still early to have a final estimate of how the spec will rank. Still, preliminary thoughts are that the spec performance is much better on the lower level keys (the main factory is the highest self-sustain) compared to the higher level ones, where you might struggle when tanking several packs together.",

On top of this, they are one of the most difficult tanks to master, further pushing the barrier of entry higher and higher (especially with that many buttons in your rotation).
