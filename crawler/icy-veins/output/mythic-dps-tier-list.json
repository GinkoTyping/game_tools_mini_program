The most recent damage nerfs will negatively impact their rankings and demotem them down a tier. Furthermore, they are one of the few melee specs that is a 5-target hard capped, which significantly reduces its AoE output past 5 targets (compared to the rest of the DPS) On a good note, they have done a general revamp of the Warrior tree so now more than ever you will enjoy higher durability (+10% Stamina)and extra mobility! In addition, their Mythic+ toolkit remains mostly the same, having the lowest utility options across all DPS specs.",

          "desc": "Arcane Mage has received its fair share of changes leading to the Season 2 of TWW. The general playstyle has seen some shifts with the priority of spells, depending on your overall talent choice, and making their minor cooldown - [大法师之触] stronger. This will directly result in improvement in their consistent damage since that was one of the major issues leading up to the patch. In addition to all of that, Arcane has one of the strongest tier-sets with a massive power spike attached to them. They will retain its burst-orientated profile while simultaneously providing priority-target damage when doing so. The rankings of Arcane can fluctuate depending on the key level, as the higher the key goes the better the spec becomes (due to mobs having higher health and enduring your whole burst). Complexity issues / Hybrid builds are still part of the problem, making the barrier to entry one of the highest among all specs, which is never a good thing.",

The spec will retain their great consistent damage, but unfortunately will still be target-capped. Their single-target will remain mid, as well as their priority-target damage while doing AoE. The lack of burst is also another issue the spec is suffering from, as that can be quite offsetting on the lower level keys where burst is important to capitalize on the lower health mobs. Their defensive profile will remain unchanged, and so will their amazing group-wide utility and mob control.",
