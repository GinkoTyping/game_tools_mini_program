          "desc": "Vengeance Demon Hunter is entering Season 2 in a much better spot compared to the previous season. One of the biggest changes is the buff to the durability toolkit of the spec, allowing you to have less \"kiting\" tanking than before. The spec still possesses one of the best mob controls across any tanking spec in Mythic+, which will turn valuable for any team looking for a tank. One of their biggest advantages is having one of the highest damage profiles across all tank specs (even after the bug fixes), extremely high self-sustain and great mob-control, which are the mains reason why we believe their current performance warrants S-tier.",

Although the recent nerfs will lower their durability and DPS numbers, they will still have one of the highest outputs across all tanks. In addition, they have incredible mob control which is another reason why the spec is so highly desired. Overall, they are currently ranked as one of the better tank entering Season 2.",

They are getting a new tier set supported by a hefty amount of RNG and arguably worse than what the Season 1 set had to offer. In addition, defensively and offensively are at a disadvantage compared to the top-ranked tanks, further pushing them down the list. Overall, it is still early to have a final estimate of how the spec will rank. Still, preliminary thoughts are that the spec performance is much better on the lower level keys (the main factory is the highest self-sustain) compared to the higher level ones, where you might struggle when tanking several packs together.",
          "descZH": "不幸的是，鲜血死亡骑士在迈向M+第二季的过程中并没有太多的改动。他们将获得一套新的套装，这套装备由大量的随机元素支持，而且可以说比第一季的套装更差。此外，与排名靠前的坦克相比，他们在防御和进攻方面都处于劣势，这进一步导致他们的排名下降。总的来说，现在对专精的最终排名进行预测还为时过早。不过，初步的看法是，与高级钥匙相比，该专精在低级钥匙中的表现要好得多（主要原因是拥有最高的自我恢复能力），而在高级钥匙中，当你同时坦克多个怪物群时可能会遇到困难。",

Luckily, the compensation buffs that came, (% flat damage adjustments, stronger [无视苦痛], and better self-sustain thanks to more Rage) which makes up for all the other nerfs. In addition, a new recent build has been discovered, making their single-target and AoE damage their strongest asset, which immensely improves their performance. Although, it has been confirmed that a small portion of that is due to unintentional buff that should have only affected Arms warriors ( [Demolish]) and is soon likely to be hotfixed (which will result in a minor damage loss). In addition, the spec will continue to have durability troubles at time (especially against continuous magical damage), which may require more healer attention than other tanks.",

But, usual issues yet remain to be solved: not enough self-sustain, which often relies on much more \"babysitting\" from your healer. On top of this, they are one of the most difficult tanks to master, further pushing the barrier of entry higher and higher (especially with that many buttons in your rotation). We expect further tuning to hit PTR and hopefully, we can revisit the rankings.",
