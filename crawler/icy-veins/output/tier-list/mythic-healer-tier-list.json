Their healing/damage output still appears to be great, which is the most important factor when rankings specs. In addition, they will retain their strong external utility packages such as 2x [痛苦压制] and [真言术：障]. Further tuning will tell how they turn out, but as of now, they remain as one of the best healers.",

One of the best things to ever happen to the spec is the introduction of [青玉赋能] which allows your [碎玉闪电] do to a ton of single-target/priority-target and AoE damage while also healing you allies (like an extra minor cooldown). That in combination with how great [翡翠羁绊] talent has been (especially the CDR thanks to [朱鹤下凡]) makes them crazy good. Mistweaver's current HPS profile is amazing as it can easily tackle any given encounter in Mythic+ while contributing to the team with its great damage profile (yes, most of your damage still requires you to be in melee). All of this combined plays well with the strong utility package they offer, cementing them as one of the best healers for Season 2.",

There are a few more survivability notes that could strengthen their durability further while keeping your incredible party-wide utility unchanged. Both their damage and healing profiles are in a good state, so watch out for this spec, this could be the dark horse of the season.",

All of this combined allows [[圣洁鸣钟]] to have a shorter cooldown which makes it easier to tackle hard healing checks which come frequently. So both healing and damage output at the moment are better than what they were in the previous season. Their toolkit remains the same - one of the best party-wide utilities paired with strong defensiveness (even immunity), and excellent mob control. Overall, we expect them to continue to be a solid choice for a healer going into Season 2, but further output buffs must be implemented before we rank them higher.",

They still have the shortest offensive and defensive ability range among all healers, which is a massive issue. Their performance, more specifically their damage and healing output, has been great, making it a great pick up with any group composition. Overall, they do not stand out as the best healing option for Mythic+ simply because of how hard it is to make them work in a pug environment and inability to compete with the top healing specs for pure output.

In addition, they will continue to face the same limitations as in Season 1 - low mobility and insufficient mob control (just like Discipline Priest). Additionally, they are one of the few healing specializations lacking an interrupt spell, which makes their mob-control one of the weakest, compared to the rest of the healing specs. However, it is noteworthy that this specialization is considered one of the easier healing options due to its reactive healing capabilities, which are adept at addressing any form of incoming or sustained HPS challenges, complemented by robust spot-healing.",
