Their healing/damage output still appears to be great, which is the most important factor when rankings specs. In addition, they will retain their strong external utility packages such as 2x [痛苦压制] and [真言术：障]. Although their healing output from [救赎] has been recently nerfed, we believe that they will still be one of the best healing choices in Season 2.",

There are a few more survivability notes that could strengthen their durability further while keeping your incredible party-wide utility unchanged. Both their damage and healing profiles are in a good state, so watch out for this spec, this could be the dark horse of the season.",

One of the best things to ever happen to the spec is the introduction of [青玉赋能] which allows your [碎玉闪电] do to a ton of single-target/priority-target and AoE damage while also healing you allies (like an extra minor cooldown). That in combination with how great [翡翠羁绊] talent has been (especially the CDR thanks to [朱鹤下凡]) makes them crazy good. Mistweaver's current HPS profile is amazing as it can easily tackle any given encounter in Mythic+ while contributing to the team with its great damage profile (yes, even after the most recent nerfs). All of this combined plays well with the strong utility package they offer, cementing them to be a great healing choice for Season 2.",

All of this combined allows [[圣洁鸣钟]] to have a shorter cooldown which makes it easier to tackle hard healing checks which come frequently. The most recent buffs to their output (both healing and DPS) will positively affect their rankings. Their toolkit remains the same - one of the best party-wide utilities paired with strong defensiveness (even immunity), and excellent mob control. Overall, we expect them to continue to be a solid choice for a healer going into Season 2, especially after the most recent output buffs.",

They will maintain their decent DPS and HPS profiles, which output is not enough to rank them higher on the tierlist compared to the rest of the healing specs. In addition, they will continue to face the same limitations as in Season 1 - low mobility and insufficient mob control (just like Discipline Priest). Additionally, they are one of the few healing specializations lacking an interrupt spell, which makes their mob-control one of the weakest, compared to the rest of the healing specs.

Their performance, more specifically their damage and healing output, has been great, making it a great pick up with any group composition. Overall, they do not stand out as the best healing option for Mythic+ simply because of how hard it is to make them work in a pug environment and inability to compete with the top healing specs for pure output.
