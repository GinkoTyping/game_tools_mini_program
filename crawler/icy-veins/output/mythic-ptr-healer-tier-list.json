Mistweaver's current HPS profile is good, as it can easily tackle any given encounter in Mythic+ while contributing to the team with its great damage profile (yes, most of your damage still requires you to be in melee). All of this combined plays well with the strong utility package they offer, while still being a contender for the best fit within the physical oriented teams. One downside of Mistweaver is that your external defensive options are the weakest out of any healing as [作茧缚命] is the weakest external option out of all healers.",
