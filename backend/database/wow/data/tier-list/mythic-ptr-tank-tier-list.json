One of the biggest changes is their great tier set, which is considered one of the strongest tank tier sets so far. The spec still possesses one of the best mob control across any tanking spec in Mythic+. They have incredibly high damage output, extremely high self-sustain, and are one of the most durable tanks so far. We believe their current performance warrants S-tier.",

Their performance is currently amazing, with significantly better mitigation and one of the highest damage outputs. We believe that Brewmaster monk is the perfect contender tank for the physical comps, which can further elevate their rankings due to the [玄秘掌] value. This is likely the best version of the spec we had for a long time and we are excited to see how it progresses through the season.",

The spec self-sustain has skyrocketed, which improves the durability of Protection Warrior, and although continuous magical damage can be an issue, they are quite durable against heavy physical damage. In addition, they have one of the highest damage output across all tank specs, which is a large influence on their overall rankings.

Although their damage profile is looking to be incredible, durability improvements are needed in order for them to climb the rankings, as it is their only issue for now. They have incredible mob control, one of the best 5-man utilities, and an immunity, which is a reason why the spec is so highly desired when properly tuned. If they receive their long-awaited durability buffs, I won't be surprised to see them in a commanding position.",

Most notable is their tier set, which doesn't offer as much power spike compared to its tank competition, and the removal of [憎恶附肢], which will make stacking mobs much harder. Blood Death Knight is the only tank spec without a raid buff, further crippling them in a 5-man content. In addition, defensively and offensively are at a disadvantage compared to the top-ranked tanks, further pushing them down the list.",
