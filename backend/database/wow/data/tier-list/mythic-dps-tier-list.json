The most recent damage nerfs will negatively impact their rankings and demotem them down a tier. Furthermore, they are one of the few melee specs that is a 5-target hard capped, which significantly reduces its AoE output past 5 targets (compared to the rest of the DPS) On a good note, they have done a general revamp of the Warrior tree so now more than ever you will enjoy higher durability (+10% Stamina)and extra mobility! In addition, their Mythic+ toolkit remains mostly the same, having the lowest utility options across all DPS specs.",

Their powers have been significantly reduced with the most recent [变换流沙] and [亲如胞友] major nerfs. In addition, [黑檀之力] has been redesigned and no longer buffs tanks/healers, which is another massive blow to the spec. They will retain their great utility, good mob control, and the ability to bolster your team's defensive and offensive profiles (especially as a DPS player), but this time, with a much smaller impact. While there is still immense value in taking Augmentation Evoker to your team, it will no longer be as dominant and thus, for the first time in 2 years, Aug is falling off the S-tier rankings.",
