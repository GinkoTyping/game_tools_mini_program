Overall, it provides significant offensive and defensive value, and picks up even more value in M+, where the lion's share of damage is parryable. While it will not be reliable per hit, it statistically averages to a very generous amount of damage reduction, direct bonus damage from crits, indirect bonus damage from parry hasting, and significant burst-down protection in modest amounts, particularly when other additive sources of avoidance are in play ([ 符文刃舞], Night Elves, etc).
